## The two things to know before anything else

**Coordinates are field coordinates.** Origin at field centre, heading CCW from
+X. `new Point(-36, -36)` is a fixed spot, and the library must be told where the
robot starts via the localizer's `startPose`. See
[Paths](paths.md#coordinates).

**Units are yours; angles are radians.** Every builder takes a `DistanceUnit` and
converts at the boundary. Angles are always radians, with no unit switch — use
`Math.toRadians()` at the call site.
