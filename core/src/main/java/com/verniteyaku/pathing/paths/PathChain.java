/**
 * An ordered run of {@link PathSegment}s driven as one continuous motion.
 *
 * <p>The chain presents itself to the follower as a single curve parameterised by
 * arc length from 0 to {@link #length()}, hiding the segment boundaries. That is
 * what lets one motion profile span the whole chain instead of stopping and
 * restarting at every junction.
 *
 * <p>Segments are not required to be continuous. A gap or a corner between two
 * segments is legal and simply means the robot has to get there; it is worth
 * knowing that a sharp corner will be profiled as if it were smooth, so the
 * follower will cut it somewhat. Build a proper curve if that matters.
