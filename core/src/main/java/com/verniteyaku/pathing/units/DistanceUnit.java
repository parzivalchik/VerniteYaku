/**
 * Linear distance unit.
 *
 * <p>VerniteYaku stores every distance internally in <b>inches</b>. That is an
 * implementation detail: you never have to work in inches. A unit is attached at
 * the boundary -- when you build a path, configure a drivetrain, or read a pose
 * back out -- and converted to the canonical unit immediately. Nothing inside the
 * follower, the profile, or the kinematics ever carries a unit tag around, so
 * there is no way for a centimetre to leak into a computation expecting inches.
 *
 * <p>Angles are always radians, everywhere, with no unit switch. See
 * {@code Conventions} in the README.
