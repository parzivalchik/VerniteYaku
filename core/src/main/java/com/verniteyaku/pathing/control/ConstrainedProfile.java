/**
 * A motion profile that respects a velocity ceiling which varies along the path.
 *
 * <p>{@link MotionProfile} assumes one speed limit for the whole distance and
 * solves it in closed form. That is not enough once a segment wants its own cap
 * -- a slow, careful approach into a scoring position followed by a fast run back
 * across the field. A single trapezoid can only be as fast as the slowest part of
 * the path.
 *
 * <p>So this solves it numerically instead, with the standard forward-backward
 * sweep:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Sample the path at a fixed arc-length step and read the velocity ceiling
 *       at each point.</li>
 *   <li><b>Forward pass</b>, from rest: at each step, go no faster than
 *       acceleration could have got you there from the previous step. This
 *       enforces "you cannot speed up faster than the robot can".</li>
 *   <li><b>Backward pass</b>, from rest at the end: at each step, go no faster
 *       than you could still brake from to meet the next step's speed. This
 *       enforces "you must already be slowing down before you reach the slow
 *       bit" -- which is the part a naive per-segment profile gets wrong, by
 *       arriving at a slow segment still going fast and then braking harder than
 *       the robot can.</li>
 *   <li>Integrate the resulting speeds to get a time for each sample.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>With a constant ceiling this reproduces {@link MotionProfile}'s trapezoid,
 * which is asserted in the tests.
