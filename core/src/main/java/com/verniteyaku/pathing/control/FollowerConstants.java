 * <p>Distances are given in whatever {@link DistanceUnit} the builder is created
 * with and stored canonically; angles are always radians.
 *
 * <p>Feedforward convention: motor power for a wheel is
 * {@code kS * sign(v) + kV * v + kA * a}, with {@code v} in inches per second and
 * {@code a} in inches per second squared. So {@code kV} is roughly
 * {@code 1 / maxWheelVelocity} for a robot that reaches top speed at full power,
