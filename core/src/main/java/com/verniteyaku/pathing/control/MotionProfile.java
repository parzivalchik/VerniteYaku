 * A trapezoidal motion profile over a fixed distance, starting and ending at
 * rest.
 *
 * <p>The profile is the "time-consistent" half of the follower: it decides where
 * the robot is supposed to be at every instant, independently of where it
 * actually is. That makes an auto repeatable -- the same path takes the same
 * number of seconds every run -- which is what you want when the rest of the auto
 * is timed around it.
 *
 * <p>When the distance is too short to reach the cruise velocity the profile
 * degenerates to a triangle, accelerating to whatever peak speed still leaves
 * room to stop.
