/**
 * A robot pose: a position plus a heading.
 *
 * <p><b>Frame.</b> Poses are absolute <i>field</i> coordinates: the origin is the
 * centre of the field, +X and +Y lie in the floor plane, and heading is
 * CCW-positive radians from +X. See {@link FieldCoordinates} for the full
 * convention and the one axis question you have to settle on a real field.
 *
 * <p>So a pose means the same thing whichever tile the robot started on, and
 * {@code new Pose2d(24, 0, 0)} is a fixed spot two feet from centre. The cost is
 * that the library must be told where the robot begins -- absolute coordinates
 * cannot be inferred from encoders. Give your localizer a {@code startPose}.
