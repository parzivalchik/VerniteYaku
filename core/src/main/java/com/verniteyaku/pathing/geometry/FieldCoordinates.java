/**
 * The field coordinate frame every pose and path point in this library lives in.
 *
 * <h2>The frame</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Origin</b> at the centre of the field, on the floor.</li>
 *   <li><b>+X</b> and <b>+Y</b> in the floor plane, right-handed with +Z up.</li>
 *   <li><b>Heading</b> in radians, CCW-positive, measured from +X.</li>
 *   <li>The field is {@value #FIELD_SIZE_INCHES} inches square, so every
 *       coordinate lies in [-72, +72].</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So {@code new Point(24, 0)} is a fixed spot on the field — two feet from
 * centre along +X — and it means the same thing whichever tile the robot starts
 * on. This is the same convention the FTC SDK's AprilTag support uses, which is
 * what lets a tag observation drop straight into the pose filter.
 *
 * <h2>The one thing you must confirm on the field</h2>
 * The origin and the handedness above are not negotiable. <b>Which physical wall
 * +X points at is a choice</b>, and it has to match how your AprilTag layout and
 * your heading sensor are set up. This library deliberately does not bake in a
 * season-specific wall mapping, because getting that silently wrong is expensive
 * and it is one line for you to pin down.
 *
 * <p>Check it once, on a real field, before trusting a long auto: place the robot
 * at a known spot facing a known wall, call {@link
 * com.verniteyaku.pathing.localization.Localizer#getPose()}, and confirm the
 * signs are what you expect. If +X turns out to point at the opposite wall,
 * rotate your whole plan by 180 degrees rather than negating coordinates
 * one at a time.
 *
 * <h2>Starting pose</h2>
 * Because coordinates are absolute, the library has to be told where the robot
 * actually is when the auto begins — it cannot work that out from the encoders.
 * Give the localizer a {@code startPose}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * OdometryComputerLocalizer localizer = OdometryComputerLocalizer.builder(tracker)
 *         .startPose(new Pose2d(-60, -36, 0))   // where the robot is placed
 *         .build();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Get that wrong and every path in the auto is offset by the same error,
 * which usually looks like the robot "driving the right shape in the wrong
 * place". It is the first thing to check when an auto is uniformly off.
