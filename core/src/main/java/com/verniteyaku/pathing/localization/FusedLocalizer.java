/**
 * The Phase 2 localizer: wheel odometry predicts, the IMU corrects, and vision
 * corrects too once something implements {@link VisionPoseSource}.
 *
 * <p>Drop-in replacement for {@link DriveEncoderLocalizer} -- same interface, and
 * the follower cannot tell the difference. The distinction is in how the IMU is
 * used. The encoder localizer simply overwrites wheel-derived rotation with the
 * gyro's. This one treats the gyro as a measurement with a variance, so a
 * momentarily confused IMU nudges the estimate instead of dictating it, and the
 * filter also learns something about <i>position</i> from a heading measurement
 * through the correlations the covariance carries.
