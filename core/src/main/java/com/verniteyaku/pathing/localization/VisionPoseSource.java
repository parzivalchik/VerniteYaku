/**
 * A source of absolute pose observations -- in practice, AprilTags.
 *
 * <p><b>STUB. Nothing implements this yet.</b> The interface and the plumbing in
 * {@link FusedLocalizer} that consumes it are finished and tested against
 * scripted observations; what is deliberately not built is the AprilTag half --
 * camera calibration, tag-field layout, and turning a detection into a
 * field-coordinate pose. That is listed as unbuilt in the README.
 *
 * <p>It exists now because the shape of this interface constrains the filter's
 * design, and getting that wrong would mean rewriting the fusion layer later. In
 * particular, an observation must carry its own uncertainty: a tag seen head-on
 * at two feet and the same tag glimpsed at the frame's edge at ten feet are not
 * remotely the same measurement, and a fusion layer that cannot tell them apart
 * has no way to behave sensibly.
 *
 * <p>Field coordinates make the rest of this markedly simpler than the old
 * start-relative frame did: tag positions are fixed and published, so nothing in
 * the pipeline needs to know where the robot began.
 *
 * <h2>Implementing this later</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Return {@code null} from {@link #getObservation()} whenever there is no
 *       fresh detection. The localizer skips the update; it never blocks.</li>
 *   <li>Report the pose in <b>field coordinates</b>. This is the easy direction:
 *       a tag's field position is fixed and published, so a detection converts
 *       straight into an absolute pose without any knowledge of where the robot
 *       started.</li>
 *   <li>Scale the variances with observed range and viewing angle. Constant
 *       variances would defeat the purpose of fusing at all.</li>
 * </ul>
