/**
 * An external device that tracks the robot's pose on its own.
 *
 * <p>A goBILDA Pinpoint or a SparkFun OTOS reads its own odometry pods, fuses
 * them with an onboard gyro, and hands back a finished pose. That is a different
 * thing from a raw sensor: there is nothing left for this library to filter, and
 * feeding an already-fused pose through {@link EKFPoseFuser} would be filtering
 * twice and trusting the result more for it.
 *
 * <p>So this interface is deliberately coarse -- a pose and a velocity, not
 * encoder counts. {@link OdometryComputerLocalizer} wraps it and the follower
 * cannot tell the difference from any other localizer.
 *
 * <p>No FTC SDK types appear here, so an implementation can be faked in a plain
 * JUnit test. The real adapter is roughly thirty lines and lives in your
 * TeamCode next to the vendor's driver -- see {@code examples/pinpoint/}.
