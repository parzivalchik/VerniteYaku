/**
 * Localization from an {@link OdometryComputer} -- a goBILDA Pinpoint, a
 * SparkFun OTOS, or anything else that tracks its own pose.
 *
 * <p>The most accurate option this library offers, and the simplest: the device
 * has already fused its pods with its own gyro, so there is nothing here but
 * reading it, watching its health, and reporting a pose the follower can use.
 *
 * <p><b>No filtering is applied on top.</b> {@link FusedLocalizer} exists to
 * combine a drivetrain's own noisy encoders with a separate gyro; running an
 * already-fused pose through it again would smooth an estimate that is better
 * than anything the extra filter knows about, add lag, and -- worse -- shrink
 * the reported covariance as though two independent measurements had agreed,
 * when there is only one.
 *
 * <h2>Health</h2>
 * These devices fail in ways drive encoders cannot: a pod cable pulls out, the
 * gyro runs away, an I2C read is dropped. When that happens the pose is stale or
 * wrong but still <i>numerically plausible</i>, which is the dangerous case.
 *
 * <p>So {@link #getConfidence()} drops to zero on a fault and the follower
 * scales its correction authority back accordingly, rather than driving hard
 * toward a position the robot is not at. The last good pose is held rather than
 * replaced by garbage, and {@link #getHealthDetail()} says what went wrong.
 * Whether that should abort the auto is the OpMode's decision, not this class's.
