/**
 * Fits {@code kS}, {@code kV} and {@code kA} online by recursive least squares.
 *
 * <p>The feedforward model is linear in its parameters:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * u = kS * sign(v) + kV * v + kA * a
 *   = theta . x,   theta = [kS, kV, kA],  x = [sign(v), v, a]
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>so every control loop hands this class one regressor row and one observed
 * normalised voltage, and least squares does the rest. No dedicated tuning
 * OpMode, no driving the robot back and forth at fixed powers while reading a
 * graph -- the model fits itself from whatever the robot happened to do.
 *
 * <p>{@code u} must be the <b>battery-normalised</b> applied voltage,
 * {@code duty * vBattery / 12}, not the raw duty cycle. See {@link
 * FeedforwardGains}.
 *
 * <h2>Forgetting</h2>
 * Old samples decay by {@code forgettingFactor} each step, so the fit tracks a
 * robot that changes during a match -- a belt tightening up, a wheel picking up
 * grit, a battery aging. Values near 1 average over a long history and are
 * stable but slow; lower values chase recent data and get twitchy. 0.98 to 0.995
 * is the usable band, which is roughly a 200 to 2000 sample memory.
 *
 * <h2>What this class deliberately does not do</h2>
 * It never touches a running follower. It produces an estimate; deciding when
 * that estimate is safe to adopt is {@link TunableFeedforward}'s job, and the
 * answer is never "in the middle of a path".

     * uncertainty no matter how cleanly the data fits. {@code P} is an inverse
