/**
 * Holds the feedforward gains the follower is currently using, and the ones it
 * will switch to next.
 *
 * <p>The whole point of this class is the gap between those two. Feedforward
 * constants must not change while a path is being followed: the profile was
 * planned against one model, and swapping the model underneath it mid-path makes
 * the robot's response discontinuous at an arbitrary moment. Worse, it makes the
 * failure unreproducible -- the same auto behaves differently depending on how
 * much the tuner happened to learn beforehand.
 *
 * <p>So the tuner {@link #propose}s at any time, and the follower {@link
 * #commitPending()}s only when it starts a new path. The rule is enforced by the
 * structure rather than by remembering to obey it.
 *
 * <p>A proposal is also screened before it can be adopted: implausible fits are
 * refused outright, and a fit that barely differs from what is already active is
 * not worth the disruption of swapping.
