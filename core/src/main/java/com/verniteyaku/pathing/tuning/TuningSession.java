/**
 * Runs the feedforward fit from live robot data.
 *
 * <p>Call {@link #update(double[])} once per control loop with the powers just
 * commanded. It reads back what the wheels actually did, converts the commanded
 * duty into a battery-normalised voltage, differentiates velocity to get
 * acceleration, and feeds one row per wheel into the {@link FeedforwardTuner}.
 *
 * <p>All four wheels feed a single model, because the follower applies a single
 * set of constants to all four. Fitting per-wheel models would describe the robot
 * more precisely and then have nowhere to put the answer.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here ever changes what the follower is doing. It proposes; the
 * follower adopts at its next path boundary. See {@link TunableFeedforward}.
