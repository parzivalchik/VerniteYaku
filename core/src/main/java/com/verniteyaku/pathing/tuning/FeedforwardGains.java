/**
 * The three feedforward constants, as one immutable value.
 *
 * <p>Motor command for a wheel is {@code kS * sign(v) + kV * v + kA * a}, where
 * {@code v} is inches per second and {@code a} is inches per second squared. The
 * result is a <b>battery-normalised</b> command in [-1, 1]: it is the fraction of
 * <i>nominal</i> (12 V) voltage the wheel needs, not a raw duty cycle. Converting
 * that to a duty cycle at the current battery voltage is the drivetrain's job.
 *
 * <p>That distinction matters more than it looks. A duty cycle of 0.5 means
 * something different at 13 V than at 11 V, so a model fitted against raw duty
 * silently re-fits itself every time the battery sags -- which is exactly when
 * autos start missing.
