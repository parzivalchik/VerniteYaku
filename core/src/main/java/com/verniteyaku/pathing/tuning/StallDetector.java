/**
 * Watches each drive motor's current draw against what the tuned feedforward
 * model says it ought to be, and reports the ones that disagree for long enough
 * to matter.
 *
 * <h2>Why not just a current threshold</h2>
 * A fixed "over 6 amps means stalled" trips constantly during hard acceleration,
 * when a healthy motor legitimately pulls a lot, and misses a genuine stall at
 * low commanded power, where a wedged wheel might only draw three. Current alone
 * does not say whether a motor is in trouble; current <i>compared with what this
 * motion should cost</i> does.
 *
 * <h2>The model</h2>
 * A DC motor's electrical behaviour is
 *
 * <pre>{@code V_applied = I * R + V_backEmf}</pre>
 *
 * so the current follows from the applied voltage and the speed:
 *
 * <pre>{@code I = (V_applied - V_backEmf) / R}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Both terms come from things already known. {@code V_applied} is the
 * commanded duty times the battery voltage. The back EMF is exactly what the
 * feedforward's {@code kV * v} term represents -- the fraction of nominal
 * voltage needed to sustain that speed -- so it is {@code kV * v * 12}. And
 * {@code R} follows from the motor's stall current on its datasheet, since a
 * stalled motor has no back EMF at all: {@code R = 12 / I_stall}.
 *
 * <h2>Commanded speed, not measured speed</h2>
 * The back-EMF term uses the velocity the follower <b>asked</b> for, not the one
 * the encoder reports. This is the entire trick, and getting it backwards makes
 * the detector useless.
 *
 * <p>Predicting from measured velocity is self-fulfilling: a wedged wheel reads
 * zero speed, so the model predicts zero back EMF and therefore a large current
 * -- exactly the large current the motor is really drawing. Measured and
 * predicted agree perfectly and nothing ever looks wrong.
 *
 * <p>Predicting from commanded velocity asks a different and useful question:
 * "if this wheel were turning as fast as we told it to, what would it cost?" A
 * healthy wheel is spinning, generating back EMF, and drawing little. A stalled
 * one generates none, so it draws several times the prediction. That gap is the
 * signal.
 *
 * <h2>Debouncing</h2>
 * Current readings on a Control Hub are noisy, and a momentary spike crossing a
 * wheel seam is not a stall. The condition must hold continuously for {@code
 * debounceSeconds} -- 150 to 300 ms is the useful range -- before anything fires.
