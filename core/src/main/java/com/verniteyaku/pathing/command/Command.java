package com.verniteyaku.pathing.command;

/**
 * A unit of work that advances a little each control loop.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately minimal, and deliberately <b>not</b> a framework. There is no
 * scheduler singleton here, no subsystem model, no requirement declarations, and
 * no exclusive-resource arbitration. Those are the parts of a command library
 * that force themselves on the rest of your code, and a path-following library
 * has no business imposing them.
 *
 * <p>What this gives you is composition: a way to say "drive this path, then
 * drop the sample, then drive that path" without hand-rolling a state machine
 * with an integer and a switch. If you already use FTCLib or Road Runner's
 * actions, ignore this package entirely -- {@link
 * com.verniteyaku.pathing.follower.Follower} is designed to be driven directly
 * from either, and nothing in the follower knows this package exists.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #initialize()} once, on the first {@code execute} cycle;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #execute()} every loop until {@link #isFinished()} returns true;</li>
 *   <li>{@link #end(boolean)} once, with {@code interrupted} saying whether it
 *       finished on its own terms or was cancelled.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A command must not block. Everything here is cooperative: one call, one
 * loop's worth of progress, then return.
