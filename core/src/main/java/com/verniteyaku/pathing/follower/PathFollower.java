/**
 * A hybrid follower: a time-parameterised motion profile with per-wheel
 * feedforward, PID correction back onto the profile's setpoint, and an
 * error-scaled reactive term on top.
 *
 * <p>Each loop it asks the profile where the robot ought to be by now, converts
 * that into a target point and velocity on the path, adds a PID term proportional
 * to how far off the robot actually is, and pushes the result through the
 * drivetrain's kinematics. Because the setpoint advances on a clock rather than
 * on measured progress, a path takes the same time every run -- and a robot that
 * gets shoved does not lose its place in the profile, it just develops an error
 * the PID then works off.
 *
 * <p>On top of that sits the reactive term: correction authority scales with the
 * magnitude of the pose error, so the follower stays a tight profile tracker
 * while it is on-path and becomes aggressive once it is knocked well off. See
 * {@link #computeCorrection}.
