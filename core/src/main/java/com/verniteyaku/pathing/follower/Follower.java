 * Drives the robot along a {@link PathChain}.

 * exclusive-resource model, and no assumption that you are using one. The
 * follower does exactly one thing per {@code update()} call and tells you whether
 * it is finished; how you sequence that against the rest of your auto is yours to
 * decide. It composes with FTCLib commands, with Road Runner actions, with a
 * hand-rolled state machine, or with a plain {@code while} loop.
 *
 * <p>The expected shape of an auto:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * follower.followPath(chain);
 * while (opModeIsActive() && follower.isBusy()) {
 *     follower.update();
 *     telemetry.addData("pose", follower.getPose());
 *     telemetry.update();
 * }
 * }</pre>
