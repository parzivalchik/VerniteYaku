/**
 * Holds the robot at a fixed pose, correcting whatever pushes it off.
 *
 * <p>{@link PathFollower} deliberately stops when its profile runs out: an auto
 * that fought to stay on its last waypoint for the rest of the match would be a
 * surprise, not a feature. This is the opposite tool -- parked at a scoring
 * position while a mechanism runs, or braced against a partner robot leaning on
 * you, it keeps correcting until told to stop.
 *
 * <p>It is the follower's correction law with the profile removed. The target
 * velocity is zero, so there is no path feedforward; everything commanded is
 * error correction, scaled by the same reactive authority and pose confidence
 * the follower uses, pushed through the same kinematics.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * holder.hold(new Pose2d(-36, -36, Math.toRadians(90)));
 * while (opModeIsActive() && armIsMoving()) {
 *     holder.update();
 * }
 * holder.stop();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>The deadband</h2>
 * Inside {@code positionTolerance} and {@code headingTolerance} the motors are
 * cut rather than trimmed. A PID asked to hold a stationary robot exactly will
 * hunt around the target forever, which on a real drivetrain is audible buzzing,
 * warm motors and wasted battery for no positional gain. The cost is that the
 * robot may drift up to one tolerance before anything resists -- so set the
 * tolerances to what you actually need, not to the smallest number you can.
